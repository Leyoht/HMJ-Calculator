# jMDatabase
The idea here is to develop a program that provides the user the ability to search for movie titles, actors, directors or any other element corresponding to a movie on the basis of information they already have. You can think of it as the international movie database (IMDB) that’s on the internet, just a smaller scale. There are a few some classes that we have considered. These include: movie title, genre, director, actors, movie length (time class), release date (time class), movie description (without spoilers), budget, box office revenue, and awards. We would have an external API that would compile review scores from places like IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes. Another API could potentially be used for the movie’s soundtrack.
